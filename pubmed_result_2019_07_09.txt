AB  - PURPOSE:: This article reports on a pilot study of a smart home for elders (SHfE)
      designed to continuously monitor senior adults' daily behaviors and the living
      environment of their residential homes using the application of unobtrusive
      sensors. SHfE users include older adults, their family members, and healthcare
      staff. BACKGROUND:: Globally, countries are experiencing the challenges of an
      increasingly aging population. A healthy environment is essential to support
      aging in place. By applying information and communications technology to building
      environments to support health, smart homes may be an option to provide a
      low-cost, comfortable, and user-friendly living environment for older adults.
      METHOD:: A pilot study was conducted in a capital city in the Yangtze River Delta
      Agglomerations in China to verify the feasibility of the SHfE. One female older
      adult participated in the pilot study, which was conducted from November 2015 to 
      January 2016. RESULTS:: The results indicated that the SHfE is a feasible way to 
      analyze the behaviors (e.g., sleeping, cooking, water usage) of the elder and
      monitor the built environment (e.g., temperature, windows, and doors).
      CONCLUSIONS:: The pilot study can be used as a baseline for further comprehensive
      experiments, case studies, and surveys to gain a better understanding of a smart 
      healthy environment for older adults. On the basis of the current study, several 
      recommendations are put forward for further implementation of the SHfE, including
      integrating multiple unobtrusive sensing devices; detecting fall accidents;
      monitoring indoor lighting, noise, and ventilation; remotely controlling
      electrical appliances; and developing the system with various languages. It is
      anticipated that the SHfE will be adopted in seniors' residential homes in
      countries around the world which face an increasingly aging population.

AB  - In the context of an aging population, tools to help elderly to live
      independently must be developed. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the
      possibility of using unobtrusively collected activity-aware smart home behavioral
      data to automatically detect one of the most common consequences of aging:
      functional health decline. After gathering the longitudinal smart home data of 29
      older adults for an average of >2years, we automatically labeled the data with
      corresponding activity classes and extracted time-series statistics containing 10
      behavioral features. Using this data, we created regression models to predict
      absolute and standardized functional health scores, as well as classification
      models to detect reliable absolute change and positive and negative fluctuations 
      in everyday functioning. Functional health was assessed every six months by means
      of the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living-Compensation (IADL-C) scale.
      Results show that total IADL-C score and subscores can be predicted by means of
      activity-aware smart home data, as well as a reliable change in these scores.
      Positive and negative fluctuations in everyday functioning are harder to detect
      using in-home behavioral data, yet changes in social skills have shown to be
      predictable. Future work must focus on improving the sensitivity of the presented
      models and performing an in-depth feature selection to improve overall accuracy.

T1  - Electronic Assessment of Physical Decline in Geriatric Cancer Patients.
PG  - 26
DOI - 10.1007/s11912-018-0670-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to explore state-of-the-art
      remote monitoring and emerging new sensing technologies for in-home physical
      assessment and their application/potential in cancer care. In addition, we
      discuss the main functional and non-functional requirements and research
      challenges of employing such technologies in real-world settings. RECENT
      FINDINGS: With rapid growth in aging population, effective and efficient patient 
      care has become an important topic. Advances in remote monitoring and in its
      forefront in-home physical assessment technologies play a fundamental role in
      reducing the cost and improving the quality of care by complementing the
      traditional in-clinic healthcare. However, there is a gap in medical research
      community regarding the applicability and potential outcomes of such systems.
      While some studies reported positive outcomes using remote assessment
      technologies, such as web/smart phone-based self-reports and wearable sensors,
      the cancer research community is still lacking far behind. Thorough investigation
      of more advanced technologies in cancer care is warranted.

T1  - Technological Health Intervention in Population Aging to Assist People to Work
      Smarter not Harder: Qualitative Study.
PG  - e3
DOI - 10.2196/jmir.8977 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Technology-based health care has been promoted as an effective tool
      to enable clinicians to work smarter. However, some health stakeholders believe
      technology will compel users to work harder by creating extra work. OBJECTIVE:
      The objective of this study was to investigate how and why electronic health
      (eHealth) has been applied in Taiwan and to suggest implications that may inspire
      other countries facing similar challenges. METHODS: A qualitative methodology was
      adopted to obtain insightful inputs from deeper probing. Taiwan was selected as a
      typical case study, given its aging population, advanced technology, and
      comprehensive health care system. This study investigated 38 stakeholders in the 
      health care ecosystem through in-depth interviews and focus groups, which
      provides an open, flexible, and enlightening way to study complex, dynamic, and
      interactive situations through informal conversation or a more structured,
      directed discussion. RESULTS: First, respondents indicated that the use of
      technology can enable seamless patient care and clinical benefits such as
      flexibility in time management. Second, the results suggested that a leader's
      vision, authority, and management skills might influence success in health care
      innovation. Finally, the results implied that both internal and external
      organizational governance are highly relevant for implementing technology-based
      innovation in health care. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided Taiwanese
      perspectives on how to intelligently use technology to benefit health care and
      debated the perception that technology prevents human interaction between
      clinicians and patients.

T1  - Health-Assistive Smart Homes for Aging in Place: Leading the Way for Integration 
      of the Asian Immigrant Minority Voice.
PG  - 154-159
DOI - 10.31372/20180304.1087 [doi]
AB  - Caring for America's aging population is a complex humanitarian issue. The number
      of older adults is expected to increase to 98.5 million by 2060 with a 295%
      growth in foreign-born older adults, including Asian immigrants. Most older
      adults will have one or more chronic conditions and 95% of healthcare costs will 
      be attributed to caring for these conditions. Among Asian Americans, common
      chronic conditions include respiratory disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease,
      and pain. The National Institutes of Health, Institute on Aging, and National
      Science Foundation call for innovative technologies to be developed by
      multidisciplinary teams to address these concerns. Asian community leaders at
      Asian Health & Service Center and community members in Oregon identified the use 
      of health-assistive technologies as a priority for potentially reducing stress
      and improving quality of life for both older adults and their caregivers. The
      purpose of this article is to introduce nurses and healthcare workers, advocating
      for the interests of Asian/Pacific Island community members, to the innovative
      health-assistive smart home. The health-assistive smart home uses artificial
      intelligence to identify and predict health events. Inclusion of minority
      persons' data in the development of artificial intelligence has been generally
      overlooked. This may result in continued health inequities and is incompatible
      with the goals of global health. Integration of minority voices while exploring
      the efficacious use of the health-assistive smart home is of significant value to
      minority populations. Asian immigrant older adults engaging in smart home
      research and development will enhance the cultural and technical safety of future
      devices. Asian families may be particularly interested in smart homes for
      extending independence because they place an emphasis on collective culture and
      family-based care. Community engagement of stakeholders and steadfast leadership 
      are needed so that future technologies used in healthcare delivery are both
      technically and culturally sound. A community-engaged research approach promotes 
      community empowerment that is responsive to community identified priorities and
      is a good fit for studying adoption of smart home monitoring for
      health-assistance.

T1  - Smart Homes for Elderly Healthcare-Recent Advances and Research Challenges.
DOI - E2496 [pii]
DOI - 10.3390/s17112496 [doi]
AB  - Advancements in medical science and technology, medicine and public health
      coupled with increased consciousness about nutrition and environmental and
      personal hygiene have paved the way for the dramatic increase in life expectancy 
      globally in the past several decades. However, increased life expectancy has
      given rise to an increasing aging population, thus jeopardizing the
      socio-economic structure of many countries in terms of costs associated with
      elderly healthcare and wellbeing. In order to cope with the growing need for
      elderly healthcare services, it is essential to develop affordable, unobtrusive
      and easy-to-use healthcare solutions. Smart homes, which incorporate
      environmental and wearable medical sensors, actuators, and modern communication
      and information technologies, can enable continuous and remote monitoring of
      elderly health and wellbeing at a low cost. Smart homes may allow the elderly to 
      stay in their comfortable home environments instead of expensive and limited
      healthcare facilities. Healthcare personnel can also keep track of the overall
      health condition of the elderly in real-time and provide feedback and support
      from distant facilities. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive review 
      on the state-of-the-art research and development in smart home based remote
      healthcare technologies.

      undoubtedly a topic of great relevance given the aging of the world population.
      The AAL technologies are designed to meet the needs of the aging population in
      order to maintain their independence as long as possible. As people typically
      spend more than 90% of their time in indoor environments, indoor air quality
      (iAQ) is perceived as an imperative variable to be controlled for the
      inhabitants' wellbeing and comfort. Advances in networking, sensors, and embedded
      devices have made it possible to monitor and provide assistance to people in
      their homes. The continuous technological advancements make it possible to build 
      smart objects with great capabilities for sensing and connecting several possible
      advancements in ambient assisted living systems architectures. Indoor
      environments are characterized by several pollutant sources. Most of the
      monitoring frameworks instantly accessible are exceptionally costly and only
      permit the gathering of arbitrary examples. iAQ is an indoor air quality system
      based on an Internet of Things paradigm that incorporates in its construction
      Arduino, ESP8266, and XBee technologies for processing and data transmission and 
      micro sensors for data acquisition. It also allows access to data collected
      through web access and through a mobile application in real time, and this data
      can be accessed by doctors in order to support medical diagnostics. Five smaller 
      scale sensors of natural parameters (air temperature, moistness, carbon monoxide,
      carbon dioxide, and glow) were utilized. Different sensors can be included to
      check for particular contamination. The results reveal that the system can give a
      viable indoor air quality appraisal in order to anticipate technical
      interventions for improving indoor air quality. Indeed indoor air quality might
      be distinctively contrasted with what is normal for a quality living environment.

T1  - Sensing Home: A Cost-Effective Design for Smart Home via Heterogeneous Wireless
      Networks.

DOI - 10.3390/s151229797 [doi]
AB  - The aging population has inspired the marketing of advanced real time devices for
      home health care, more and more wearable devices and mobile applications, which
      have emerged in this field. However, to properly collect behavior information,
      accurately recognize human activities, and deploy the whole system in a real
      living environment is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a feasible
      wireless-based solution to deploy a data collection scheme, activity recognition 
      model, feedback control and mobile integration via heterogeneous networks. We
      compared and found a suitable algorithm that can be run on cost-efficient
      embedded devices. Specifically, we use the Super Set Transformation method to map
      the raw data into a sparse binary matrix. Furthermore, designed front-end devices
      of low power consumption gather the living data of the habitant via ZigBee to
      reduce the burden of wiring work. Finally, we evaluated our approach and show it 
      can achieve a theoretical time-slice accuracy of 98%. The mapping solution we
      propose is compatible with more wearable devices and mobile apps.

T1  - Evaluation of Three State-of-the-Art Classifiers for Recognition of Activities of
      Daily Living from Smart Home Ambient Data.
PG  - 11725-40
DOI - 10.3390/s150511725 [doi]
AB  - Smart homes for the aging population have recently started attracting the
      attention of the research community. The "health state" of smart homes is
      comprised of many different levels; starting with the physical health of
      citizens, it also includes longer-term health norms and outcomes, as well as the 
      arena of positive behavior changes. One of the problems of interest is to monitor
      the activities of daily living (ADL) of the elderly, aiming at their protection
      and well-being. For this purpose, we installed passive infrared (PIR) sensors to 
      detect motion in a specific area inside a smart apartment and used them to
      collect a set of ADL. In a novel approach, we describe a technology that allows
      the ground truth collected in one smart home to train activity recognition
      systems for other smart homes. We asked the users to label all instances of all
      ADL only once and subsequently applied data mining techniques to cluster in-home 
      sensor firings. Each cluster would therefore represent the instances of the same 
      activity. Once the clusters were associated to their corresponding activities,
      our system was able to recognize future activities. To improve the activity
      recognition accuracy, our system preprocessed raw sensor data by identifying
      overlapping activities. To evaluate the recognition performance from a 200-day
      dataset, we implemented three different active learning classification algorithms
      and compared their performance: naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM)
      and random forest (RF). Based on our results, the RF classifier recognized
      activities with an average specificity of 96.53%, a sensitivity of 68.49%, a
      precision of 74.41% and an F-measure of 71.33%, outperforming both the NB and SVM
      classifiers. Further clustering markedly improved the results of the RF
      classifier. An activity recognition system based on PIR sensors in conjunction
      with a clustering classification approach was able to detect ADL from datasets
      collected from different homes. Thus, our PIR-based smart home technology could
      improve care and provide valuable information to better understand the
      functioning of our societies, as well as to inform both individual and collective
      action in a smart city scenario.

T1  - The Elderly's Independent Living in Smart Homes: A Characterization of Activities
      and Sensing Infrastructure Survey to Facilitate Services Development.
PG  - 11312-62
DOI - 10.3390/s150511312 [doi]
AB  - Human activity detection within smart homes is one of the basis of unobtrusive
      wellness monitoring of a rapidly aging population in developed countries. Most
      works in this area use the concept of "activity" as the building block with which
      to construct applications such as healthcare monitoring or ambient assisted
      living. The process of identifying a specific activity encompasses the selection 
      of the appropriate set of sensors, the correct preprocessing of their provided
      raw data and the learning/reasoning using this information. If the selection of
      the sensors and the data processing methods are wrongly performed, the whole
      activity detection process may fail, leading to the consequent failure of the
      whole application. Related to this, the main contributions of this review are the
      following: first, we propose a classification of the main activities considered
      in smart home scenarios which are targeted to older people's independent living, 
      as well as their characterization and formalized context representation; second, 
      we perform a classification of sensors and data processing methods that are
      suitable for the detection of the aforementioned activities. Our aim is to help
      researchers and developers in these lower-level technical aspects that are
      nevertheless fundamental for the success of the complete application.

T1  - Towards a future robotic home environment: a survey.
PG  - 268-80
DOI - 10.1159/000363698 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Demographic change has resulted in an increase of elderly people, while 
      at the same time the number of active working people is falling. In the future,
      there will be less caretaking, which is necessary to support the aging
      population. In order to enable the aged population to live in dignity, they
      should be able to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) as independently as
      possible. The aim of this paper is to describe several solutions and concepts
      that can support elderly people in their ADLs in a way that allows them to stay
      self-sufficient for as long as possible. METHOD: To reach this goal, the Building
      Realization and Robotics Lab is researching in the field of ambient assisted
      living. The idea is to implement robots and sensors in the home environment so as
      to efficiently support the inhabitants in their ADLs and eventually increase
      their independence. Through embedding vital sensors into furniture and using ICT 
      technologies, the health status of elderly people can be remotely evaluated by a 
      physician or family members. By investigating ergonomic aspects specific to
      elderly people (e.g. via an age-simulation suit), it is possible to develop and
      test new concepts and novel applications, which will offer innovative solutions. 
      Via the introduction of mechatronics and robotics, the home environment can be
      made able to seamlessly interact with the inhabitant through gestures, vocal
      commands, and visual recognition algorithms. Meanwhile, several solutions have
      been developed that address how to build a smart home environment in order to
      create an ambient assisted environment. This article describes how these concepts
      were developed. The approach for each concept, proposed in this article, was
      performed as follows: (1) research of needs, (2) creating definitions of
      requirements, (3) identification of necessary technology and processes, (4)
      building initial concepts, (5) experiments in a real environment, and (6)
      development of the final concepts. To keep these concepts cost-effective, the
      suggested solutions are modular. Therefore, it will be possible to
      straightforwardly install the proposed devices in an existing home environment in
      a 'plug and play' manner once the terminals can be prefabricated off-site.
      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This article shows a variety of concepts that have been
      developed to support elderly people in their ADLs. The prototypes of the proposed
      concepts in this paper have been tested with elderly people. The results of the
      tests show that robots embedded in furniture, walls, ceiling, etc. offer enhanced
      support, properly addressing elderly as well as disabled people to individually
      and independently manage their ADLs. In order to make the concepts realizable in 
      terms of cost, it will be necessary to standardize and modularize these concepts 
      for industrial fabrication.

T1  - Mobilizing Older Adults: Harnessing the Potential of Smart Home Technologies.
      Contribution of the IMIA Working Group on Smart Homes and Ambient Assisted
      Living.
PG  - 94-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper highlights the potential of smart home applications to not
      only assess mobility determinants for older adults in the home environment but
      also provide the opportunity for tailored interventions. METHODS: We present a
      theoretical framework for assessing mobility parameters and utilizing this
      information to enable behavior change based on the Health Belief Model. We
      discuss examples that showcase the potential of smart home systems to not only
      measure but also improve mobility for community dwelling older adults. RESULTS:
      Mobility is a complex construct that cannot be addressed with a single monitoring
      approach or a single intervention. Instead, tailored interventions that address
      specific needs and behaviors of individuals and take into consideration
      preferences of older adults and potentially their social network are needed to
      effectively enforce positive behavior change. Smart home systems have the ability
      to capture details of one's daily living that could otherwise not be easily
      obtained; however, such data repositories alone are not sufficient to improve
      clinical outcomes if appropriate mechanisms for data mining and analysis, as well
      as tailored response systems are not in place. CONCLUSIONS: Unleashing the
      potential of smart home applications to measure and improve mobility has the
      potential of transforming elder care and providing potentially cost-effective
      tools to support independence for older adults. A technologically driven smart
      home application can maximize its clinical relevance by pursuing interactive
      features that can lead to behavior change.

T1  - Smart homes and ambient assisted living applications: from data to
      knowledge-empowering or overwhelming older adults? Contribution of the IMIA Smart
      Homes and Ambiant Assisted Living Working Group.
PG  - 51-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: As health care systems face limited resources and workforce shortages
      to address the complex needs of older adult populations, innovative approaches
      utilizing information technology can support aging. Smart Home and Ambient
      Assisted Living (SHAAL) systems utilize advanced and ubiquitous technologies
      including sensors and other devices that are integrated in the residential
      infrastructure or wearable, to capture data describing activities of daily living
      and health related events. This paper highlights how data from SHAAL systems can 
      lead to information and knowledge that ultimately improves clinical outcomes and 
      quality of life for older adults as well as quality of health care services.
      METHODS: We conducted a review of personal health record applications
      specifically for older adults and approaches to using information to improve
      elder care. We present a framework that showcases how data captured from SHAAL
      systems can be processed to provide meaningful information that becomes part of a
      personal health record. RESULTS: Synthesis and visualization of information
      resulting from SHAAL systems can lead to knowledge and support education,
      delivery of tailored interventions and if needed, transitions in care. Such
      actions can involve multiple stakeholders as part of shared decision making.
      CONCLUSION: SHAAL systems have the potential to support aging and improve quality
      of life and decision making for older adults and their families. The framework
      presented in this paper demonstrates how emphasis needs to be placed into
      extracting meaningful information from new innovative systems that will support
      decision making. The challenge for informatics designers and researchers is to
      facilitate an evolution of SHAAL systems expanding beyond demonstration projects 
      to actual interventions that will improve health care for older adults.

T1  - Enabling affordable and efficiently deployed location based smart home systems.
PG  - 221-35
DOI - 10.3233/THC-2009-0549 [doi]
AB  - With the obvious eldercare capabilities of smart environments it is a question of
      "when", rather than "if", these technologies will be routinely integrated into
      the design of future houses. In the meantime, health monitoring applications must
      be integrated into already complete home environments. However, there is
      significant effort involved in installing the hardware necessary to monitor the
      movements of an elder throughout an environment. Our work seeks to address the
      high infrastructure requirements of traditional location-based smart home systems
      by developing an extremely low infrastructure localisation technique. A study of 
      the most efficient method of obtaining calibration data for an environment is
      conducted and different mobile devices are compared for localisation accuracy and
      cost trade-off. It is believed that these developments will contribute towards
      more efficiently deployed location-based smart home systems.

T1  - Model and algorithmic framework for detection and correction of cognitive errors.
PG  - 203-19
DOI - 10.3233/THC-2009-0548 [doi]
AB  - This paper outlines an approach that we are taking for elder-care applications in
      the smart home, involving cognitive errors and their compensation. Our approach
      involves high level modeling of daily activities of the elderly by breaking down 
      these activities into smaller units, which can then be automatically recognized
      at a low level by collections of sensors placed in the homes of the elderly. This
      separation allows us to employ plan recognition algorithms and systems at a high 
      level, while developing stand-alone activity recognition algorithms and systems
      at a low level. It also allows the mixing and matching of multi-modality sensors 
      of various kinds that go to support the same high level requirement. Currently
      our plan recognition algorithms are still at a conceptual stage, whereas a number
      of low level activity recognition algorithms and systems have been developed.
      Herein we present our model for plan recognition, providing a brief survey of the
      background literature. We also present some concrete results that we have
      achieved for activity recognition, emphasizing how these results are incorporated
      into the overall plan recognition system.

T1  - A smart home application to eldercare: current status and lessons learned.
PG  - 183-201
DOI - 10.3233/THC-2009-0551 [doi]
AB  - To address an aging population, we have been investigating sensor networks for
      monitoring older adults in their homes. In this paper, we report ongoing work in 
      which passive sensor networks have been installed in 17 apartments in an aging in
      place eldercare facility. The network under development includes simple motion
      sensors, video sensors, and a bed sensor that captures sleep restlessness and
      pulse and respiration levels. Data collection has been ongoing for over two years
      in some apartments. This longevity in sensor data collection is allowing us to
      study the data and develop algorithms for identifying alert conditions such as
      falls, as well as extracting typical daily activity patterns for an individual.
      The goal is to capture patterns representing physical and cognitive health
      conditions and then recognize when activity patterns begin to deviate from the
      norm. In doing so, we strive to provide early detection of potential problems
      which may lead to serious health events if left unattended. We describe the
      components of the network and show examples of logged sensor data with correlated
      references to health events. A summary is also included on the challenges
      encountered and the lessons learned as a result of our experiences in monitoring 
      aging adults in their homes.

T1  - Home care decision support using an Arden engine--merging smart home and vital
      signs data.
PG  - 483-7
AB  - UNLABELLED: The demographic change with a rising proportion of very old people
      and diminishing resources leads to an intensification of the use of telemedicine 
      and home care concepts. To provide individualized decision support, data from
      different sources, e.g. vital signs sensors and home environmental sensors, need 
      to be combined and analyzed together. Furthermore, a standardized decision
      support approach is necessary. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our research work is to
      present a laboratory prototype home care architecture that integrates data from
      different sources and uses a decision support system based on the HL7 standard
      Arden Syntax for Medical Logical Modules. METHODS: Data from environmental
      sensors connected to a home bus system are stored in a data base along with data 
      from wireless medical sensors. All data are analyzed using an Arden engine with
      the medical knowledge represented in Medical Logic Modules. RESULTS: Multi-modal 
      data from four different sensors in the home environment are stored in a single
      data base and are analyzed using an HL7 standard conformant decision support
      system. CONCLUSION: Individualized home care decision support must be based on
      all data available, including context data from smart home systems and medical
      data from electronic health records. Our prototype implementation shows the
      feasibility of using an Arden engine for decision support in a home setting. Our 
      future work will include the utilization of medical background knowledge for
      individualized decision support, as there is no one-size-fits-all knowledge base 
      in medicine.

AB  - Elders live preferently in their own home, but with aging comes the loss of
      autonomy and associated risks. In order to help them live longer in safe
      conditions, we need a tool to automatically detect their loss of autonomy by
      assessing the degree of performance of activities of daily living. This article

T1  - Health smart home: towards an assistant tool for automatic assessment of the
      dependence of elders.
PG  - 3806-9
AB  - In order to help elders living alone to age in place independently and safely, it
      can be useful to have an assistant tool that can automatically assess their
      dependence and issue an alert if there is any loss of autonomy. The dependence
      can be assessed by the degree of performance, by the elders, of activities of
      daily living. This article presents an approach enabling the activity recognition
      for an elder living alone in a Health Smart Home equipped with noninvasive

T1  - Aging well with smart technology.
PG  - 329-38
AB  - As baby-boomers age, the need for long-term nursing care services increases. In
      the future, there will simply not be enough long-term care facilities to
      accommodate all of these patients. In addition, many people prefer to grow old at
      home, a concept known as aging-in-place. Smart home technology facilities
      aging-in-place by assisting patients with emergency assistance, fall
      prevention/detection, reminder systems, medication administration and assistance 
      for those with hearing, visual or cognitive impairments. Benefits include making 
      aging-in-place a reality, continuous monitoring, and improved psychosocial
      effects. Concerns of this technology include cost, availability of technology,
      retrofitting complications, and potential inappropriate use of the technology.
      Overall, the concept of smart homes is gaining in popularity and will expand the 
      role of the nurse in the future. It is important for all nurses to understand how
      their practices will be transformed as smart homes become a reality for the aging
      population.
